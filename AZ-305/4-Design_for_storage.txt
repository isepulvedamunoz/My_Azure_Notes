Design for data and storage for relational solutions


Ways to deploy an Data Base instance in Azure


    SQL databases

        Azure SQL Database is a PaaS deployment option of Azure SQL that abstracts both the OS and the SQL Server instance. 
        It is a highly scalable, intelligent, relational database service built for the cloud with the industry's highest availability SLA.


        - All modern characteristics for storage

        - SQL Database is also the only deployment option that supports scenarios that require:

        - Very large databases (currently up to 100TB)

        - Autoscaling for unpredictable workloads (serverless)



    Managment instance

    Azure SQL Managed Instance is a PaaS deployment option of Azure SQL. It provides an instance of SQL Server, 
    but removes much of the overhead of managing a virtual machine. Most of the features available in SQL Server 
    are available in SQL Managed Instance.

        - Lift and shift migration from on-premises

        - Automatic patching and version updates

        - Automated backups

        - High availability

        - Reduced management overhead


        

    SQL server on virtual machines

        - All your SQL Server skills should directly transfer, though Azure can help automate backups and security patches.

        - You have access to the full capabilities of SQL Server

        - You're responsible for updating and patching the OS and SQL Server
